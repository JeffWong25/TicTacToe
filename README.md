This is a simple WPF game project I built by following OttoBotCodeâ€™s tutorial on YouTube.

About

The project helped me learn:
Building desktop applications using WPF in C#
Designing UI with XAML
Handling mouse input and game loops
Implementing basic game logic 

From this project, I learned about:

Structuring a simple WPF game with Grid and Button controls
Using commands and events to handle gameplay
Managing game state and checking for winners programmatically

Notes

This is primarily a learning project following the tutorial.
All credit for the core idea and structure goes to OttoBotCode.
